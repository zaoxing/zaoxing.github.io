Topics covered in this course will include application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP), transport layer protocols (UDP, TCP), network layer protocols (e.g., IP, ICMP), link layer protocols (e.g., Ethernet) and wireless protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11). The course will also cover routing protocols such as link state and distance vector, multicast routing, and path vector protocols (e.g., BGP). The class will examine security issues such as firewalls and denial of service attacks. We will also study DNS, NAT, Web caching and CDNs, peer to peer, and protocol tunneling. Finally, we will explore security protocols (e.g., TLS, SSH, IPsec), as well as some basic cryptography necessary to understand these. Grading will be
based on hands-on programming assignments and two exams.
