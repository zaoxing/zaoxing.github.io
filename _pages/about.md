About me
======
I'm a computer systems enthusiast who work on networks, systems, and security. More professionally, I'm an Assistant Professor in [ECE](https://www.bu.edu/eng/departments/ece/) and [CS](https://www.bu.edu/cs/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). My research has won interdisciplinary recognitions, including USENIX FAST Best Paper Award, USENIX ATC "Best of Rest", and ACM STOC "Best of Rest". Prior to BU, I did a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University and obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University.

**I'm looking for self-motivated students who are interested in systems and networking research.** My group has 2 PhD positions available! If you are interested in joining forces with me, feel free to drop me an email with your CV.

**Feel free to contact me if you are interested in research internship opportunites.**

Research
------
I'm broadly interested in systems and networking. I design, implement, evaluate systems and algorithmic tools for telemetry, in-network computing, ML/analytics, and network security.

**Network Telemetry and Management**
- Sketch-based Telemetry for Heterogeneous and Dynamic Networks [[HeteroSketch, NSDI'22](/papers/2022/NSDI2022_HeteroSketch.pdf)]
- Efficient Library to Deploy Sketches on Hardware [[SketchLib, NSDI'22](/papers/2022/NSDI2022_SketchLib.pdf)]
- Arbitary Partial Key Queries on Network Hardware [[CocoSketch, SIGCOMM'21](/papers/2021/SIGCOMM21-CocoSketch.pdf)]
- Precise Error Estimation for Sketch Queries [[ErrorEstimator, IMC'21](/papers/2021/IMC21_ErrorEstimation.pdf)]
